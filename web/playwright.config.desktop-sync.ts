/**
 * Bidirectional desktop↔web config sync (`npm run e2e:desktop-sync`).
 *
 * Unlike every other config here, a REAL AGENT PROCESS runs for the whole
 * session: `python owlette_runner.py` against a scratch `%PROGRAMDATA%` in the
 * OS temp dir, holding an Auth-emulator token with agent claims and writing
 * through the real `firestore.rules`. That is the point — this is the only suite
 * where the agent is a participant rather than a mock.
 *
 * `webServer` and `use` are taken from `playwright.config.ts` rather than
 * restated: the emulator env block there is long, load-bearing, and must not
 * fork. Everything else differs, so nothing else is inherited.
 *
 * Two projects:
 * - `tier0` runs headless and proves the loop closes. It needs no desktop binary.
 * - `tier1-desktop` drives the app itself and SKIPS unless OWLETTE_DESKTOP_EXE
 *   names a build. Running it kills the operator's tray (the app is
 *   single-instance) — see `e2e/desktop-sync/README.md`.
 *
 * workers: 1 and retries: 0 — one agent, one window, one emulator, and a sync
 * that only works on the second attempt is a bug worth seeing.
