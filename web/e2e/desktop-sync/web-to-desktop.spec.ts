/**
 * Tier 1, downstream — an operator edits the dashboard, the machine follows.
 *
 * This is the half `e2e/specs/dashboard/process-config-roundtrip.spec.ts` cannot
 * reach. That file stops at the config document, because nothing in the main
 * suite plays the agent. Here a real agent is polling it, so the chain runs all
 * the way to the window on the operator's desk:
 *
 *   dialog save → PATCH → `config/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}`
 *     → agent config listener (adaptive 2–10s, `firebase_client._config_listener_loop`)
 *     → `handle_config_update` writes config.json
 *     → the desktop app's file watcher (120ms) + React's 80ms debounce
 *     → the field on screen
 *
 * Hence the 30s budget: it is the sum of real intervals, not a guess, and the
 * 10s idle ceiling on the agent's listener is the dominant term.
 *
 * The dashboard renders process rows from the STATUS doc, which only the agent
 * writes — so the row is located by its SEEDED name throughout, exactly as the
 * web-only roundtrip spec does. What changes on screen is the DESKTOP app.
 *
 * NOT EXECUTED as part of the change that introduced it: running this kills the
 * operator's tray (the app is single-instance). See README.md.
