/**
 * hoot's internal shared secret — presented by every server-to-server caller of the internal
 * endpoints (`/api/hoot/autonomous`, `/api/hoot/escalation`, `/api/alerts/trigger`,
 * `/api/talons/internal/match`, and the audit-emit hop in `lib/auditLogClient.ts`).
 *
 * The env var is still `CORTEX_INTERNAL_SECRET`: it is provisioned on Railway (dev + prod), Vercel
 * and the Firebase Functions runtime config, and `functions/src/lib/requireInternalSecret` compares
 * the same value. Renaming means rotating one secret across four deploy targets in a single release
 * window, so the name stays and this module is the only place in `web/` that spells it.
 *
 * Read at call time, not module scope, so a test that assigns the var after import still sees it.
 * See `web/lib/hoot/WIRE_NAMES.md` for the full survivor inventory.
