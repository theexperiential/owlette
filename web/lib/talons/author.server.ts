/**
 * Fire-time re-resolution of a talon's AUTHOR — the person an unattended run
 * acts as and whose llm key it spends. BYOK is one key in one place
 * (`users/{uid}/settings/llm`), so there is no site-shared key to fall back
 * to; `createdBy` names whose key a 3am talon spends.
 *
 * Access is re-resolved on EVERY run — never trusted from authoring time.
 *
 * Every {@link TalonAuthorError} is UNRECOVERABLE: the next firing fails
 * identically, so the engine disables the talon on the spot. That is why
 * `verifyUserSiteAccess` throws a typed `SiteAccessError` — a Firestore outage
 * surfaces as a different class and escapes this module un-narrowed, so an
 * unreachable database can never disable a talon.
 *
 * Server-side only — never import this in client components.
