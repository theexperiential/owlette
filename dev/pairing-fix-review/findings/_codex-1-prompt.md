You are codex reviewer #1 in a 15-agent review of ONE uncommitted change to agent/src/configure_site.py (the agent device-code pairing flow). You are at the repo root.

FIRST read: dev/pairing-fix-review/BRIEF.md — it has the full context, the EXACT diff, established facts, how to inspect, severity discipline, and the output format. Follow it.

YOUR ASSIGNED ANGLE (#1): Static/syntax integrity. Confirm the final file parses (ast.parse), no undefined names, no leftover references to the removed 'choice' var or a now-unused symbol, and that 'import threading' is fully gone (added-then-removed in this edit). Run flake8/pyflakes if available. Confirm BOLD/DIM/RESET/CYAN/_open_browser/pairing_url are all still defined and used correctly in the new lines.

Rules: READ-ONLY — never modify any file (the change is the user's uncommitted work). Inspect with `git diff -- agent/src/configure_site.py`, `git show HEAD:agent/src/configure_site.py`, `rg`, and read the named files. For syntax checks use `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('agent/src/configure_site.py').read())"` (no file writes). Default to SKEPTICISM — actively try to find a scenario where this breaks pairing, the installer, silent deploy, the GUI, or anything else. Calibrate: a clean result is valid; cite file:line + a concrete scenario for any finding.

Your FINAL MESSAGE = the report in the brief's format, focused on your angle:
# angle #1 — codex findings
## Verdict: CORRECT & SAFE / SAFE-WITH-NOTES / PROBLEM-FOUND
## Findings (severity + MERGE-BLOCKER|SHIP-WITH-NOTE|NON-BLOCKING, evidence file:line, scenario, recommendation) — or "none"
## What I checked and found clean
## Bottom line: is this change safe to ship in a production installer? any MERGE-BLOCKER?
