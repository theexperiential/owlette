You are codex reviewer #4 in a 15-agent review of ONE uncommitted change to agent/src/configure_site.py (the agent device-code pairing flow). You are at the repo root.

FIRST read: dev/pairing-fix-review/BRIEF.md — it has the full context, the EXACT diff, established facts, how to inspect, severity discipline, and the output format. Follow it.

YOUR ASSIGNED ANGLE (#4): Adversarial: empty/None pairing_url. pairing_url = device_data.get('pairingUrl') or device_data.get('qrUrl',''). If it resolves to '' or None, what does _open_browser do (os.startfile('') )? Confirm it cannot raise/hang the installer and that the 'approve at the link above' fallback message fires. Trace _open_browser at configure_site.py:66.

Rules: READ-ONLY — never modify any file (the change is the user's uncommitted work). Inspect with `git diff -- agent/src/configure_site.py`, `git show HEAD:agent/src/configure_site.py`, `rg`, and read the named files. For syntax checks use `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('agent/src/configure_site.py').read())"` (no file writes). Default to SKEPTICISM — actively try to find a scenario where this breaks pairing, the installer, silent deploy, the GUI, or anything else. Calibrate: a clean result is valid; cite file:line + a concrete scenario for any finding.

Your FINAL MESSAGE = the report in the brief's format, focused on your angle:
# angle #4 — codex findings
## Verdict: CORRECT & SAFE / SAFE-WITH-NOTES / PROBLEM-FOUND
## Findings (severity + MERGE-BLOCKER|SHIP-WITH-NOTE|NON-BLOCKING, evidence file:line, scenario, recommendation) — or "none"
## What I checked and found clean
## Bottom line: is this change safe to ship in a production installer? any MERGE-BLOCKER?
