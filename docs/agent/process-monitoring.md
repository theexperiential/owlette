# process monitoring

The agent monitors configured processes every 5 seconds, detecting crashes, stalls, and exits. When a managed process goes down, the agent automatically restarts it when its launch mode is active (`always`, or `scheduled` inside a matching schedule window).

---

## process state machine

Every configured process is in one of five states:

```
                    ┌──────────┐
          launch    │ RUNNING  │  crash/exit
         ┌────────▶│          │──────────┐
         │         └──────────┘          │
         │              │                ▼
    ┌──────────┐   stall detected  ┌──────────┐
    │ STOPPED  │        │          │ KILLED   │
    │          │        ▼          │          │
    └──────────┘   ┌──────────┐   └──────────┘
         ▲         │ STALLED  │        │
         │         │          │        │ auto-restart
         │         └──────────┘        │ (if launch mode active)
         │              │              │
         │         kill after confirm  │
         └──────────────┘◀─────────────┘
```

### state definitions

| state | description | dashboard indicator |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **RUNNING** | Process is alive and responsive | Green |
| **STALLED** | Process exists but is not responding (hang detected) | Yellow |
| **KILLED** | Process was terminated (manually or by agent) | Red |
| **STOPPED** | Process is not running because launch mode is `off` or scheduled mode is outside its window | Grey |
| **INACTIVE** | Process is configured but its executable was not found | Grey (dimmed) |

## monitoring loop

Every 5 seconds, the agent runs through all configured processes:

### 1. check if process is running

The agent validates the process by:

1. **PID check** — Is there a process with the stored PID?
2. **Path verification** — Does the running process match the configured `exe_path`? (prevents PID reuse false positives)
3. **Status update** — Set state to RUNNING or detect crash

### 2. crash detection

A process is considered crashed when:

- Its PID no longer exists
- The PID exists but belongs to a different executable (PID was reused by the OS)
- The process exit code indicates abnormal termination

### 3. hang detection (multi-stage)

The agent uses a progressive approach to detect frozen applications:

| stage | time | action |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Probe** | Every 5s | `owlette_scout.py` sends `WM_NULL` to the process window |
| **Monitor** | Before 15s | Mark the process as STALLED, but keep waiting through repeated 5-second checks |
| **Confirmation** | 15s+ | If the process has stayed unresponsive for `HANG_CONFIRM_SECONDS`, kill and relaunch it |

`WM_NULL` is a harmless Windows message — if the process responds, it's alive. If it doesn't respond within the timeout, the process is likely hung.
The agent does not kill on the first failed check; it waits until the process has been unresponsive for 15 seconds.

### 4. auto-restart

When a crash is detected and launch mode is active:

1. Agent increments the **relaunch counter**
2. If under the limit (`relaunch_attempts`), restart the process
3. Wait `time_delay` seconds before starting
4. Wait `time_to_init` seconds before monitoring responsiveness
5. If at the limit, show a **reboot prompt** to the user

If PID detection fails after launch, retry attempts wait for at least `time_to_init`, with a 60-second minimum cooldown for slow-starting applications.

If the configured `exe_path` does not exist, the agent does not attempt to launch the process. On the transition into that failed state, it scans nearby sibling directories for executable paths with the same basename, sends an `exe_missing` alert with suggested paths, and writes a `process_launch_failed` log event. The alert is rate-limited by the same failed-launch marker so it does not repeat every monitoring tick.

## process launch methods

The agent uses a two-stage launch strategy:

### primary: task scheduler

```
Agent creates one-time scheduled task
    → Task runs under logged-in user account
    → Agent finds the new PID
    → Task is deleted (cleanup)
```

**Advantages**: Processes survive service restarts (not killed by NSSM job objects).

### fallback: createprocessasuser

If Task Scheduler fails, the agent falls back to `CreateProcessAsUser` via `pywin32`:

```
Agent gets user token (WTSQueryUserToken)
    → CreateProcessAsUser with the token
    → Process runs under user session
```

---

## pid recovery

When the service restarts, it doesn't re-launch processes that are already running. Instead, it **recovers** existing PIDs:

1. For each configured process, scan running processes for matching `exe_path`
2. If found, adopt the PID — mark as RUNNING without relaunching
3. If not found and launch mode is active, start the process

This prevents duplicate instances after service restarts or crashes.

---

## relaunch limits

Each process has a configurable `relaunch_attempts` limit (default: 3). When the limit is reached:

1. The agent stops trying to restart the process
2. A **reboot countdown prompt** appears on screen (`prompt_restart.py`)
3. The user can dismiss the prompt or allow the reboot
4. The relaunch counter resets after a successful process start or manual intervention

!!! tip "Crash alerts"
    When a process crashes, the agent reports the event to the web dashboard via the alert API. Agent code uses `firebase_client.send_alert(event_type, data)` as the canonical alert sender; older process/display helpers delegate to it. Failed sends are queued in memory and retried after reconnect, capped at 100 pending alerts. If email alerts are configured for the site, the dashboard sends a **process crash alert** email including the process name, machine name, and error details. Webhooks are also triggered if configured.

## metrics collection

At each heartbeat interval, the agent collects and reports (5s when the system tray is open, 30s when processes are active, 120s when idle):

| metric | source | description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **CPU** | `psutil.cpu_percent()` | Overall CPU usage percentage |
| **Memory** | `psutil.virtual_memory()` | RAM usage percentage |
| **Disk** | `psutil.disk_usage('/')` | Primary disk usage percentage |
| **GPU** | WinTmp / nvidia-ml-py | GPU usage percentage (if available) |
| **CPU Model** | Registry/psutil | CPU model name (e.g., "Intel Core i9-9900X") |
| **Processes** | Per-process | Status, PID, uptime for each configured process |

GPU monitoring uses a fallback chain:

- **NVIDIA GPUs**: GPUtil or pynvml (NVML) for load and temperature
- **Other GPUs**: WinTmp/LibreHardwareMonitor for basic metrics
- **No GPU**: Gracefully returns 0
