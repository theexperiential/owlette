# developer-preview release checklist

**Last updated**: 2026-04-28

This checklist defines the API surface that is safe to point internal consumers at on `dev.owlette.app` or a staging deployment. It is not the external public launch checklist.

Use this page when cutting a dev push, onboarding an internal integration, or deciding whether a route belongs in the developer-preview docs.

---

## preview status

Developer preview is ready when an internal consumer can:

- create or receive a scoped API key
- verify identity with `/api/whoami`
- discover accessible sites and machines
- queue and poll a safe machine command
- use documented shared behavior for auth, errors, pagination, idempotency, and rate limits
- inspect the rendered reference at `/docs/api`

Preview does not mean the public launch packaging is complete. Status page, [public SLOs](load-testing.md), [published SDK/CLI channels](distribution.md), marketplace assets, pricing/signup pages, and first-week support runbooks remain Wave 5 launch work.

---

## release gate

Before pointing internal consumers at the preview:

- [ ] Deploy from the intended `dev` or staging branch.
- [ ] Confirm the docs route loads: `GET /docs/api`.
- [ ] Confirm raw OpenAPI loads: `GET /api/openapi`.
- [ ] Confirm the quickstart can run with a `test` key against a real dev/staging site and one online machine.
- [ ] Run `npm.cmd run validate:api` from `web`.
- [ ] Run `npm.cmd test -- --runTestsByPath __tests__/api/openapi.test.ts --runInBand` from `web`.
- [ ] Run `python -m mkdocs build` from the repository root and review any new warnings from this page or its links.
- [ ] Run the public API smoke spec when Firebase emulators are available:

```powershell
firebase.cmd emulators:exec --only auth,firestore,storage --project demo-playwright-e2e "cd web && npx.cmd playwright test specs/api-contracts/public-api-smoke.spec.ts"
```

- [ ] Run `git diff --check` before commit.
- [ ] Record any known validation blockers in the sprint log before sharing the preview link.

Known local docs-build caveat: `python -m mkdocs build --strict` currently fails on pre-existing repo-wide warnings for links to source files outside the docs tree. Treat new warnings from this page as 4.4 blockers; treat unrelated existing warnings as follow-up docs cleanup.

## safe to expose in dev/staging

These surfaces are safe for internal developer-preview consumers when accessed with least-privilege keys and test data.

| surface | safe preview scope |
|---|---|
| docs and contract | `/docs/api`, `/api/openapi`, `/api/version`, [quickstart](quickstart.md), and shared behavior docs |
| auth and identity | dashboard-created API keys, `POST /api/keys` with user session or Firebase ID token, `/api/whoami`, scoped `owk_test_*` keys |
| sites | site list/detail/create/update/delete and member add/list/remove where caller role/scope allows it |
| users | platform user management for superadmin-only internal testing |
| machines | list/detail/deployments, generic command queue, command polling, screenshots, reboot schedule, uninstall, agent-token metadata/revoke |
| processes | process list/detail/create/update/delete plus start/stop/kill/schedule/launch-mode |
| classic deployments | `/api/sites/{siteId}/deployments/**` create/list/detail/retry/cancel/uninstall/delete |
| Roost and chunks | Roost CRUD, version publish/list/detail/files/diff, chunk check/upload/download/mount/referrers, deploy/rollback/resync |
| Cortex | canonical `/api/cortex/conversations/**`; `/api/chat/**` remains a compatibility alias, not the path to promote |
| webhooks and events | webhook CRUD, delivery history/detail, manual retry, secret rotate, and `POST /api/webhooks/probe`; `/api/events/stream` liveness only |
| quota, audit, logs | quota current/history, audit-log reads, site operational log read/detail/clear with documented admin controls |
| installer management | `/api/installer/**` for superadmin/platform internal testing; unauthenticated installer download remains `/download` |
| platform utilities | documented `/api/platform/**` routes for superadmin-only internal diagnostics and operations; do not include these in general consumer handoff |

Use `test` keys for dev/staging unless the integration intentionally exercises live production data. Keep one key per integration so audit and rate-limit signals stay attributable.

## keep internal or deferred

Do not advertise these as developer-preview public APIs:

- `/api/admin/**` compatibility paths.
- `/api/agent/**` agent writeback/auth routes, except where the rendered reference explicitly documents an agent-compatible operation.
- `/api/cron/**` scheduler routes.
- Routes on the OpenAPI validator's internal allowlist, including session auth, MFA/passkeys, settings/setup helpers, bug/test-email helpers, legal/unsubscribe helpers, and dashboard-only support utilities, unless the rendered reference explicitly documents the route.
- `/api/webhooks/test`; use `POST /api/webhooks/probe` for public receiver checks.
- `/api/cortex/autonomous`, `/api/cortex/escalation`, `/api/cortex/provision-key`, and `/api/cortex/categorize`.
- Site-nested Cortex paths such as `/api/sites/{siteId}/cortex/conversations/**`.
- Dedicated display enumeration/capture paths and site-level display-layout library routes; use machine-level display layout plus generic machine commands for preview.
- Public WebRTC/live-view session APIs.
- Machine pairing UX as a general public API; current CLI/agent device-code routes are implementation surfaces.
- Machine alert mute/unmute and machine rename/edit.
- Log live-tail and bulk export.
- Production event fanout through `/api/events/stream`; current stream validates auth/filters and emits liveness events only.
- New path aliases such as `/api/installers`, `/api/sites/{siteId}/installer-deploys`, or `/api/sites/{siteId}/cortex/...`.
- New `X-Owlette-Api-Version` request header; no Owlette-wide version header is required for preview.
- External package publication, Homebrew/Scoop/winget distribution, status page, public uptime checks, launch marketing, and support SLAs. Use the [distribution gate](distribution.md) before claiming SDK or CLI packages are live.

If an internal consumer asks for one of these, record it as a follow-up instead of expanding the preview contract ad hoc.

The source of truth for the exposed route set is `web/openapi.yaml` plus the internal allowlist in `web/scripts/validate-openapi.ts`. Historical sprint references under `dev/active/public-api/reference` explain why a route is included, renamed, internal, or deferred; they are not consumer-facing docs.

---

## consumer handoff

Send internal consumers this minimal set:

- Base URL: `https://dev.owlette.app`
- Docs: `https://dev.owlette.app/docs/api`
- Quickstart: [quickstart.md](quickstart.md)
- Auth: [authentication.md](authentication.md)
- Shared behavior: [pagination.md](pagination.md), [idempotency.md](idempotency.md), [errors.md](errors.md), [rate-limits.md](rate-limits.md)
- Required setup: account, accessible site, online machine, scoped `test` API key
- Scope reminder: use exact permissions; `write` does not imply `read`
- Support payload: method, URL, status, problem `code`, `requestId`, `X-Request-Id`, and any `RateLimit-*` / `Retry-After` headers

Recommend the 10-minute quickstart as the first smoke test before SDK or CLI workflows.

---

## rollback and containment

If a preview consumer hits a release-blocking issue:

- For docs/reference drift, revert the docs/OpenAPI commit and redeploy docs.
- For an over-scoped key, revoke it or create a narrower replacement from the dashboard.
- For a route rejecting legitimate callers because of role/capability/rate-limit bugs, use the security kill switch only as a short-lived superadmin mitigation and record the reason, expiry, and follow-up fix.
- For an unsafe mutation surface, remove the route from preview docs/OpenAPI or mark it internal/deferred, then rerun `validate:api`.
- For persistent server errors, capture `requestId` and affected route before rolling back the deployment.

Never work around preview issues by sharing broader production keys or undocumented internal routes.

---

## done criteria

4.4 is done when:

- this page is in the API docs nav
- safe and deferred preview surfaces are explicit
- validation gates are listed with runnable commands
- consumer handoff links point at current Owlette API docs
- rollback and containment steps do not rely on ad hoc operator knowledge
