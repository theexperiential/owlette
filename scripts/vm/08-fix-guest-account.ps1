# Create the 'e2e' local account in the guest (and later remove the wrong one).
# Run ELEVATED, guest running, over PowerShell Direct.
#
# Why create rather than rename: Rename-LocalUser changes the account name but
# NOT its profile directory, so a renamed account still lives in C:\Users\<old>.
# That mismatch would be baked into the golden image every future run reverts
# to, and it shows up in every path, log and screenshot thereafter.
#
# The new profile is materialised by running a throwaway process AS the new user
# (Start-Process -Credential), which is what actually creates C:\Users\e2e - the
# account alone does not. No interactive logon needed for that part.
#
# Two phases, because Windows will not delete the account you are signed in as:
#   1. (default)   create e2e, make it an admin, materialise its profile
#      --> then sign the guest into e2e
#   2. -RemoveOld  delete the old account and its profile
#
# Passwords are collected with Get-Credential in THIS window, travel only over
# the VM bus, and are never printed or stored.
#
# ASCII ONLY: PowerShell 5.1 decodes a .ps1 as the system ANSI codepage unless
# the file carries a UTF-8 BOM.

#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
# See 05-prep-guest.ps1 for why this is suppressed: $CredFile is a PATH to a
# DPAPI-encrypted credential file, and the analyzer matches on the name alone.
