# bundled here rather than in 05:
#   * Set-VMVideo refuses to run on a VM that is not Off.
#   * Rename-Computer only takes effect on reboot.
#   * A deleted account's profile directory stays locked while its registry
#     hive is mounted; the hive unloads on shutdown, so the sweep works now
#     when it did not before.
