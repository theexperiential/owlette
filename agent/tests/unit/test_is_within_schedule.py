"""`shared_utils.is_within_schedule` — which clock a process window is judged on.

This function decides, every 5 seconds, whether each `launch_mode='scheduled'`
process should be running. It has been timezone-aware and DST-correct since it
was written, and until 3.3.0 it had zero tests — because nothing could ever pass
it a timezone: `site_timezone` was populated only by a Firestore read that 403s.
Wave 2 made the argument reachable, so the behaviour it has always claimed is
now load-bearing and gets pinned here.

The clock is frozen in every test that cares about "now". `is_within_schedule`
resolves `datetime` by a function-local import, so the freeze is applied to the
`datetime` module's own attribute — patching `shared_utils.datetime` would miss
it entirely.
